1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?
ðŸ‘‰Ans: var was used to declare variables in older systems (up to ES5). It is function scoped. let is used to declare variables in modern times. let can be reassigned. const Once a value is assigned, it cannot be reassigned later.



2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?
ðŸ‘‰Ans: map() operates on each element of an array and returns a new array. forEach() simply loops over each element of an array and returns nothing (always undefined). filter() filters some elements of an array according to a condition and returns a new array.



3) What are arrow functions in ES6?
ðŸ‘‰Ans: Arrow functions are a shortcut for writing functions in ES6. The syntax is short, beautiful, and simple.



4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?
ðŸ‘‰Ans: Destructuring Assignment is a feature in ES6 that allows us to easily extract individual variables from an array or object.



5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?
ðŸ‘‰Ans: Writing strings with template literals is easy, readable, and powerful, while variable interpolation and multi-line writing are much smoother.
